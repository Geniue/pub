&lt;h1&gt;Cleaning and Caring for Antique and Persian Rugs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk and oriental rugs have always been a symbol of elegance and prestige for the upper classes. The beauty of these works of art can easily be appreciated by anyone, anywhere in the world. However, there is another type of rug cleaning near me that is starting to become popular. These are the rugs and carpets that are made of &quot;antique&quot; or older materials. This is because these materials are usually rarer and much sought after than the modern ones, which are the modern, durable types of rugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points to Consider when Cleaning Antique Rugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to antique rug cleaning near me, there are a few things to consider. For one thing, it's important that you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pristinegreencleaning.com/blog/non-toxic-eco-carpet-upholstery-cleaning&quot;&gt;qualified professional perform the job&lt;/a&gt;. Professionals who know how to use the machinery necessary to get the best results are the only ones who can properly clean them. Plus, there are so many different kinds of antique rugs and carpets, it would be impossible to describe them all in a short article. It's also important to know what has been spilled on the rug. Was it just dirt or have there been pet accidents and urine? This information will influence how the rug should be cleaned. That's why we encourage consumers to research this topic online and learn as much as they can before deciding on hiring a professional near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different Methods Used for Different Type of Rugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pristinegreencleaning.com/blog/carpet-cleaning-nyc-methods&quot;&gt;different types of antique rugs and carpets have different cleaning methods.&lt;/a&gt; Some might need to be shampooed while others may just need to be pool washed So ask yourself what kind of rug cleaning near me would work best for the particular type of rug or carpet you have. For example, if you have an oriental rug, it might not be necessary to shampoo it. But don't rule it out entirely. A good professional will be able to clean it for you using the proper methods and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-Toxic Products for Oriental Rug Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you have an antique Persian carpet that is very old and dirty, chances are it is best to bring it into a professional antique rug cleaner. This is because there are special chemicals that antique carpets can safely be exposed to. The good thing about these chemicals is that they are extremely safe for the environment and safe for you and your family. It's also important to ensure that the chemicals used are certified. The downside is that you will probably have to pay quite a bit of money for professional services. So you'll need to decide if it's worth it or not before making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Clean your Antique Rugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got that out of the way, let's look at how you go about&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPutO2Lqy7Q&amp;ab_channel=Therugmaniac&quot;&gt; cleaning antique rugs&lt;/a&gt;. If it's a simple domestic rug, you can usually just rent a machine and do the job yourself. It really doesn't matter how big the antique rug is, as long as it's fairly straight and square. Once you've got it cleaned with a commercial cleaner, rinse it thoroughly, and then apply a good stain remover. Most rug cleaners have a special stain remover meant specifically for antique carpets. If yours doesn't, try using one of your home remedies first. But if the rug is a delicate antique rug, have a professional clean your oriental rug as colors can run and sore-rented machines can be too damaging for the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
