title:Can A Steam Cleaner Kill The Coronavirus?

/********************************/
&lt;h1&gt;Learning how to keep our homes safe is essential during these times. At PristineGreen, we have integrated scientific principles in our cleaning procedure to provide an extra layer of protection for our clients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus or Covid-19 has become the international threat these days with over 2 million cases reported and 7000+ deaths across the world.&amp;nbsp; It started at a small level in China, was declared a pandemic, and since then has made its way to almost every country of the world. Even as the vaccine has rolled out, preventions is still a great measure that anyone can take to stay safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schools and government offices are shut down and businesses are allowing work-from-home to the employees, but is staying at home actually safe? It can be as long as your home evironment is not a hot-bed for germs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When considering how carpet cleaning can help prevent harboring COVID-19 in your home, there are a few things to consider.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Difference between Cleaning and Disinfecting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that simply cleaning the interiors can help deal with the germs. Of course, it helps deal with the dust particles, but what about the germs that are living inside the layers of your upholstery, carpets, rugs, etc.? Cleaning simply removes the dust or germs from a surface but doesn&rsquo;t kill them. This is where the disinfecting comes into the picture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two-Part Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain complete hygiene inside the premises, even global health organizations recommend a two-part process that includes cleaning and disinfecting. It&rsquo;s just like using sanitizer after you wash your hands with soap. Disinfecting the interiors of the upholstery serves as a sanitizer that helps you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Carpet Cleaning Prevents the Spread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PristineGreen Upholstery and Carpet Cleaning, we use hot-steam as part of our cleaning procedure to add an extra layer of disinfection. Studies suggest that high heat can eliminate the presence of bacteria and viruses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Steam Cleaning as Layer for Disinfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s important to know that high-heat treatment has proven effective in killing viruses. In this case, heat is also very effective at killing the Coronavirus. Even the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-prevent-germs-from-spreading/&quot;&gt; NHS in the UK wrote that &quot;steam cleaning is effective against germs on carpets and furnishings.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even throughout the past, steam cleaning has been often highlighted as a good way to decontaminate areas. In the recent past, during the Norovirus outbreak, the authorities in the UK produced a precautionary guide for cleaning cruise ships to deal with any kind of infection using steam cleaning at a temperature of at least 70 degrees celcius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam is not just a useful choice to disinfect carpets, rugs or furniture upholstery, but it&rsquo;s also an effective choice that can be used on other surfaces for general cleaning. Research has indicated that by steaming contaminated areas for at least five minutes at 70 degrees celcius or one minute at 100 degrees celcius.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
