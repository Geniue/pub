title:Our Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning Process

/********************************/
&lt;h1&gt;At PristineGreen Cleaning, we have a highly detailed, effective cleaning process that produces amazing results.&amp;nbsp; As professionals, we clean any type of material (fabric or leather) on any carpet, upholstery, fabric or piece of furniture.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s why we developed a series of protocols which are unique to our company that effectively address all cleaning situations using only non-toxic and eco-friendly products. We are a company that cares about health and it&rsquo;s important to us to not only provide a top-of-the-line cleaning service but use only products that keep your home safe for you, your children, and your pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here is our process:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Vacuum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before working on any piece of furniture, we ensure that large pieces of debris and hair are removed using a professional-grade vacuum and specialized roller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Pre-Spray/Wetting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our packages can include a pre-spray (mild soapy solution to initially wet the item and begin breaking down the dirt) and a stain remover (a more intense but non-toxic solution that is used for taking out deep dirt, odors, oils, urine, grease, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Agitation/Scrubbing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then agitate the fabric or leather with a carefully selected brush (varying materials and stiffness) to break up dirt and oil particles so that they will further dissolve into our cleaning solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Hot Water Extraction/Rinsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we use a hot-water extractor which shoots clean, heated water into the fabric, while simultaneously sucking it up through a water-safe vacuum. Thus eliminating the dirty solution on the surface of the item while cleansing it with fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 5: Inspection/Repeat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now the item is very clean with no stains, dirt, or dust. If there are any spots that need extra attention, we begin the process over on that section until the area looks brand new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 6: Steaming/Disinfecting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the customer purchased the disinfection package, we steam the furniture to kill any possible bacteria or dust mites that may be living on the piece. We can even put an essential oil of your choice in the steam to create a luxurious smell and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclustion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally cleaning furniture regularly is important for the health of the home and the item. Stains, dirt, and dust that remain on the furniture for longer periods of time sometimes ossify into the fabric making removal near impossible. Therefore, it is important when there is an accident to call us immediately, so that we can remove the stain as quickly as possible to ensure the beauty and longevity of your furniture. Furthermore, having regular cleanings is essential for keeping your home dust free, which can cause allergies and allergic symptoms to sensitive individuals. Especially if you have a pet, it is necessary to clean your items regularly as pets naturally carry dust and dirt which will settle in the items they sit or lie on which allows dust mites and other microorganisms to breed.&lt;/p&gt;
