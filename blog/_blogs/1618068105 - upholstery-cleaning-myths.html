/********************************/
&lt;h1&gt;To find the truth from the myths for upholstery cleaning can be difficult, which is why as professional upholstery cleaners in NYC, we are here to enlighten you on the subject!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search the internet for &quot;upholstery cleaning,&rsquo; and you are likely to come across thousands of web pages sharing information. However, not all the information available online is true. In this age of the internet, misinformation abounds. You may have also tried some of the hacks on upholstery steam cleaning, but not all of them turned to be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To eliminate the wasted time and effort that you can face while using the information available online regarding furniture cleaning, we bring you the top myths of upholstery cleaning in NYC.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disinfecting &amp; cleaning are the same things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most common myths related to upholstery cleaning being the fact that both cleaning and disinfecting are not the same thing. For example, cleaning is the process of removing dirt and grime on the surface, while disinfecting helps make the surface free and clear of all microscopic organisms. In simple words, upholstery cleaning will remove dirty from your furniture, and the disinfecting will make it free from all kinds of harmful germs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use furniture polish every time you dust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply not the truth regarding home furniture cleaning. Although it is true that wooden furniture looks good when you use wood polish after cleaning, you don't need to be using it every week or even month. When using furniture polish, it creates a sticky layer on the surface and attracts dust. So, it is suggested to do the regular cleaning and not the polishing, unless you feel that your furniture is looking old and needs a fresh look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If it smells good, it&rsquo;s clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything that smells good is clean and hygienic. And it&rsquo;s also been proven by the experts that scented and unscented versions of the same product clean equally well. There are many products available on the market that leave the fragrance of pine or lavender on your furniture and upholstery, which may give you an illusion that the furniture is clean and fresh. The best way to know if the upholstery is clean is to do a detailed check. Using natural products with no added fragrance is always recommended as they make your furniture clean, really. Remember, everything that shines is not gold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean with the hottest water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your furniture upholstery is very delicate and must be treated with care using the right products. This is why our expert professionals only use the required tools to do the upholstery steam cleaning job in Brooklyn, NYC, and Queens. The use of hot water can be good to clean different kinds of surfaces like granite, floor, and even some furniture upholstery, but not all because steam cleaning with hot water on delicate fabrics can leave the surface damaged and reduce the life of your assets. Also, a poorly regulated heating system in cleaning machines may also cause fabric distortion, so make sure to ask your upholstery steam cleaning service providers if their tools are in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You can use vinegar for anything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinegar is very useful when it comes to home upholstery cleaning, but the fact here is that it is not good for all kinds of fabrics. As upholstery cleaning experts in Queens, Brooklyn, and NYC, we know it is important to understand the type of fabric your furniture has before you make any decision of using vinegar on it. This is why it is important to let the experts handle your home upholstery cleaning. The reason is that they know your furniture better than you and can implement the best solutions available to clean while increasing the life of the fabric or leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep yourself abreast with the proper knowledge and only let the experts handle the tough jobs for you. Minor cleaning can be done at home, but when your furniture and upholstery needs something special, only trust the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
