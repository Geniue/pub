/********************************/
&lt;h1&gt;Despite steam cleaning in NYC being a common means of cleansing a variety of surfaces and fabrics, there are still misconceptions about the cleaning method.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; We like to keep the public informed which is why we bring to you some most common steam cleaner beliefs you never knew were false.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steam Cleaners Are Ok For Hardwood Floors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, steam cleaners seem harmless in that they only product steam, but the truth is that they can cause damage if used on the wrong surface.

&lt;h3&gt;Steam Cleaners Can Damage Carpets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping your carpets clean is essential but what tools do you use to accomplish this task? A true steam cleaner is different than a carpet cleaner, also known as an extractor, so which do you use? Both of them are different and have been designed for specific functions. A true steam cleaner simply creates steam while an extractor shoots water into the fabric and then sucks it back up with an industrial wet vacuum. Yet using a steam cleaner on a carpet also has its purposes and is rarely harmful to the fabric, unless the carpet is particularly delicate. Steam cleaning can be used to disinfect rugs and destroy odors caused by bacteria.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steam Cleaning Carpets Causes Mold To Grow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reason behind the myth lies in the idea that mold likes dirty and wet carpets. And since steam cleavers use steam, most people believe that mold may grow in the fibers soon. If you throw water on your carpet every day, mold is likely to grow quicker than you can say &ldquo;photosynthesis.&rdquo; However, steam cleaning is different. It simply shoots hot steam into the fibers, killing any bacteria that may be lurking. This all means that the steam cleaning process doesn&rsquo;t create much dampness.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steam Cleaning Makes Carpets Get Dirty Easily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that sometimes carpets soil faster after cleaning, a ss these carpet cleaning methods a sticky residue behind that latches on to fresh dirt. In case you are getting these kinds of results after a cleaning process, it may be because of inappropriate methods used. Yet steam cleaning should not leave any residue. If a type of carpet cleaning method that does not involve a rinse is used, it is possible that a residue will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steeam Cleaners Are Only For Flooring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact here is that the steam cleaning is a versatile cleaning tool that has been effective in cleaning almost all kinds of surfaces like furniture, car upholstery, mattresses, chairs, tabletops, and more. So, no matter what you want to clean at home, steam cleaning is a tool that can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
