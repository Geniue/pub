/********************************/
&lt;h1&gt;We use Safer Choice, non-toxic products to ensure the safety of you family, your children, and your pets.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most carpet cleaners use toxins that emit dangerous fumes into your home or business.&lt;br /&gt;The residue left behind can be present for months, causing severe health issues to your family and pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We use only non-toxic products as other cleaners can be dangerous.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Toxic Products Contain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common products contain a dry cleaning chemical called perchloroethylene, which according to the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) is known to cause damage to the liver and kidneys, and cause dizziness, nausea and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other chemicals like naphthalene, listed as a possible carcinogen, is manufactured from coal tar and is considered dangerous to the human central nervous system. Some of the solvents used for dry carpet cleaning contain butyloxy ethanol, potentially causing damage to liver, central nervous system and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our carpet and upholstery cleaning products are certified by the EPA as safe!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Safer Choice label (formally known as the Design for the Environment (DFE) label), identifies products with safer ingredients, which work as well, or better than those products with harmful chemical alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product with the safer choice label means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists for safety and functionality. Making PristineGreen the safer choice for your carpet &amp; upholstery cleaner needs!&lt;/p&gt;
