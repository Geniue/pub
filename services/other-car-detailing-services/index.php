        <p><strong>
            In addition to the traditional auto detailing and auto spa services, we offer a variety of more niche services as well. Take a look!
          </strong></p>
       <p><strong>Headlight Polishing</strong></p>
        <p>Over time, road debris and UV exposure fog your headlights to the point where they are both ugly and ineffective. Micro-debris from the road, over years of driving, slowly etch and degrade the plastic on your headlights, making them foggy. In addition, UV exposure browns the headlight making it hard for light to pass through it. The end result of this abuse is an ugly headlight which is both ineffective and reduces the overal appearance of your car. Not to worry! We offer headlight renewal services which will remove all scratches and abrasions from your headlight and also remove any browning, bringing it back to its original clear state! In addition, we will apply it with UV blocking and scratching protectants so you will not have to worry about browning or hazy headlights again!</p>
      <p><strong>Clay Bar Treatment</strong></p>
        <p>Its important before the polishing stage to apply a clay bar treatment to your car's finish. What is a clay bar treatment? A clay bar treatment using a clay bar and a lubricant to catch any larger debris that has embedded itself in the paint. This is not to be confused with regular dirt and debris that comes off in the wash. The clay bar treatment happens after the wash as this debris is literally embedded in the finish so a different method of gathering it must be used. If a detailier fails to clay bar the finish, during the polishing stage, the debris will be caught in the polisher and will scratch the surface of your car with the buffer thousands of times creating more damage than was was originally there! Don't miss out on this treatment! </p>
       <p><strong>Engine Detailing</strong></p>
        <p>There is nothing more satisifying than popping the hood of a car and seeing a pristine engine bay! Engines over time can gather dirt and oils and ca become unsightly. Periodically, its important to perform an engine detail where all the dirt and oils are washed away leaving your engine and compontents looking brand new!</p>
		  <p><strong>Interior Scenting</strong></p>
        <p>As the car is the second home, we want it to be comfortable. Some individuals like no sccents whereas some love to fill the home with beautiful smells. At Stuey's, we can offer you a variety of scents for your car. We can give you the traditional scents and smells or more unique ones. We strive to offer a variety of smells which are non-toxic and dervied from natural essential oils. Live your vest life! </p>
		  <p><strong>Odor Removal</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes when we buy a new car, it smells. It can have organic smells from food or inorganic smells from chemicals, cigarette smells, or tar smells. All of these smells are uncomfortable. Let us at Stuey's perform odor removal services on your vehicle to elimiate these smells. We use professional odor removal equipment (foggers) and high quality chemicals to eliminate these odors. We do not mask the scents, we eliminate them! We are also sensitive to customers who are allergic to smells so we choose our products wisely and try to use chemicals with the lowest toxicity and fragrances. Don't fall in the trap of using ozone machines! These can both damage your car's interior forever and create toxic fumes that basically never go away! Call us first to do it the most safe and effective way!</p>
		 <p><strong>Wheel Washing</strong></p>
        <p>The wheels are an integral part of the car's exterior. They can sometimes be an art piece in themselves. This is why its important to have an entire wheel washing regiment to bring out the full beuaty and life from your wheels. The wheels have two parts: the rim and the tire. Both can be improved! For rim washing, we use specific chemicals to wash away and dirt, oils, and brake dust that has accumulated on your rims. It can be a lot! Once cleaned, they will be looking brand new! For tires, we clean the rubber deeply, removing dirt, oils, and any other chemicals that may have comes from the factory or the road. Then we dress the tire, bringing out its shine, making it look newly washed, and brand new! Well cleaned and dressed wheels bring your car to a whole new level!</p>
		 <p><strong>Paint Correction and Paint Repair</strong></p>
